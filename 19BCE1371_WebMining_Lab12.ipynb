The fact it was released about 10 minutes before midnight may reflect Mr Trump\\'s coolness towards it, and his opposition to punishing more Russians with sanctions.\\n\\nThe top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, accused the Trump administration of letting \"\"Russia off the hook again\"\" by not taking substantial action.\\n\\nWho has been named?\\n\\nInformally known as the \"\"Putin list\"\", the unclassified section has 210 names, 114 of them in the government or linked to it, or key businessmen.

worth billions, suggesting that more sanctions were not required.\\n\\nHow have the Russians reacted?\\n\\nPerhaps referring to the fact that all of their political representatives had been named, Mr Putin said that, in effect, \"\"all 146 million Russians have been put on the list\"\".\\n\\nHe joked he was offended not to be named himself.\\n\\nEarlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who is himself on the list, accepted that it was not one of sanctions but said it could potentially damage \"\"the image and reputation\"\" of figures listed and their associated companies.\\n\\nHe added: \"\"It\\'s not the first day that we live with quite aggressive comments made towards us, so we should not give in to emotions.\"\"\\n\\nWhen Caatsa was passed, PM Dmitry Medvedev said it meant the US
