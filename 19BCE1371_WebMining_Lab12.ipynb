A US Treasury Department later told Buzzfeed that an unclassified annex of the report had been derived from the magazine.', 'Why did the US publish the list?\\n\\nThe government was required to draw up the list after Congress passed the Countering America\\'s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa) in August.\\n\\nThe law aimed to punish Russia for its alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential election and its actions in Ukraine.\\n\\nCongress wanted the list to name and shame those who had benefited from close association with President Putin and put them on notice that they could be targeted for sanctions, or more sanctions, in the future.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump did not support Caatsa, even though he signed it into law, saying it was \"\"unconstitutional\"\".\\n\\nUnder the law, the list had to be delivered by Monday. The fact it was released about 10 minutes before midnight may reflect Mr Trump\\'s coolness towards it, and his opposition to punishing more Russians with sanctions.\\n\\nThe top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, accused the Trump administration of letting \"\"Russia off the hook again\"\" by not taking substantial action.\\n\\nWho has been named?\\n\\nInformally known as the \"\"Putin list\"\", the unclassified section has 210 names, 114 of them in the government or linked to it, or key businessmen.

world.\\n\\nMoscow won\\'t want that to become a Who\\'s Sanctioned.\\n\\nWhat is the Caatsa act and did the president want it?\\n\\nThe law limited the amount of money Americans could invest in

\"\"far better deals with foreign countries than Congress\".', 'Earlier on Monday, the US government argued the Caatsa law had already pushed governments around the world to cancel deals with Russia worth billions, suggesting that more sanctions were not required.\\n\\nHow have the Russians reacted?\\n\\nPerhaps referring to the fact that all of their political representatives had been named, Mr Putin said that, in effect, \"\"all 146 million Russians have been put on the list\"\".\\n\\nHe joked he was offended not to be named himself.\\n\\nEarlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who is himself on the list, accepted that it was not one of sanctions but said it could potentially damage \"\"the image and reputation\"\" of figures listed and their associated companies.\\n\\nHe added: \"\"It\\'s not the first day that we live with quite aggressive comments made towards us, so we should not give in to emotions.\"\"\\n\\nWhen Caatsa was passed, PM Dmitry Medvedev said it meant the US
