CCTV footage played in court showed Parker leaning over injured survivor Pauline Healey and taking her handbag to steal her purse, as her teenage granddaughter lay dying nearby.

Hours later, Parker was using Mrs Healey's bank card at a local McDonald's restaurant.

The court heard the footage also captured him taking photographs of the victims, including one of Mrs Healey.

Prosecutor Louise Brandon showed the judge four pictures Parker took in the foyer which, she said, he later sold for Â£100.

She said the CCTV footage shows Parker ""taking the opportunities that presented themselves to him to take photographs and to look for and, where possible, take valuable items, such as purses and mobile telephones from the bags of the victims"".

""As the tragedy unfolded around him, when the vast majority of those who were in the arena with him were trying to save lives and care for the injured and lost, the defendant was focused on seeking to take advantage of the situation,"" she added.

Parker also stole a mobile phone from a 14-year-old girl who was seriously hurt in the blast.

Miss Brandon said the teenager had been holding it at the time of the explosion.

Parker then picked it up, the court heard.
