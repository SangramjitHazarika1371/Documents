It is the first time Michelin has ever allowed a restaurant to bow out.

""It is difficult for us to have a restaurant in the guide which does not wish to be in it,"" Michelin spokesperson Claire Dorland Clauzel told AFP news agency. She said other restaurants had dropped out when chefs retired or the concept had changed.

What did Mr Bras say exactly?

The gastronomic bible's decision comes after Mr Bras, 46, spoke out about no longer being able to deal with knowing that just one below-par dish could jeopardise his reputation.

""You're inspected two or three times a year, you never know when,"" he told AFP.

""Every meal that goes out could be inspected. That means that every day one of the 500 meals that leaves the kitchen could be judged.""

Mr Bras's famed restaurant in Laguiole will not be featured in the 2018 edition of the Michelin guide to be published next Monday.
