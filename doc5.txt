Earlier on Monday, the US government argued the Caatsa law had already pushed governments around the world to cancel deals with Russia worth billions, suggesting that more sanctions were not required.

How have the Russians reacted?

Perhaps referring to the fact that all of their political representatives had been named, Mr Putin said that, in effect, ""all 146 million Russians have been put on the list"".

He joked he was offended not to be named himself.

Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who is himself on the list, accepted that it was not one of sanctions but said it could potentially damage ""the image and reputation"" of figures listed and their associated companies.

He added: ""It's not the first day that we live with quite aggressive comments made towards us, so we should not give in to emotions.""

When Caatsa was passed, PM Dmitry Medvedev said it meant the US had declared a ""full-scale trade war"" on Russia.

Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny praised the publication of the names as ""a good list"".",en
