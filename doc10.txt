Originally published in 1900 to guide French motorists to find food and lodging on the road, the Michelin guide is now exclusively dedicated to fine dining.

To be in for a chance of one of the coveted stars, restaurants first have to be in a region Michelin covers. In 2016, it made history by releasing its first-ever Singapore edition, in which it awarded stars to street stalls for the first time.

Researchers for the secretive organisation whittle down the best-reviewed restaurants by food bloggers and critics, and only after scouts draft a shortlist, do inspectors make anonymous visits to evaluate the food.

One Michelin star represents a ""very good restaurant in its category"", while two stars denotes a restaurant boasting ""excellent cooking"" that is ""worth a detour"". Three stars, however, is the ultimate honour, afforded only to those restaurants that offer ""exceptional cuisine"" that is ""worth a special journey"".

How great is the pressure on top chefs?

It is not clear what the exact recipe is to receive a recommendation or star - but chefs have been chasing these accolades for decades.

Currently, 27 French restaurants are in the elite club of holding Michelin's maximum three-star rating.

Mr Bras, who took over his three-star restaurant from his father Michel Bras almost a decade ago, accepts that by relinquishing his stars, ""maybe I will be less famous"".

Le Suquet was dubbed ""spellbinding"" by Michelin's guide and currently commands a price of up to €230 (£202; $285) for its fixed menus. Its chef says he is keen to ""start a new chapter"" in his restaurant's history, away from the ultra-competitive world of Michelin-star cooking.

He hopes he will soon be able to present tantalising dishes ""without wondering whether my creations will appeal to [the] inspectors"".
