A homeless man who stole from victims of the Manchester Arena bomb attack has been jailed.

Chris Parker was hailed a hero after saying he helped, but CCTV showed him stealing from two victims and taking photos of others as they lay dying.

The 33-year-old had previously admitted stealing a purse and a mobile phone.

Jailing him for four years and three months at Manchester Crown Court, Judge David Hernandez told Parker: ""You were not the hero you pretended to be.""

The judge added: ""You were just a common thief.""

Parker pleaded guilty to two counts of theft and one of fraud after admitting using a debit card from the stolen purse.

Judge Hernandez said: ""You stole from people who were seriously injured at a time when others were either dead or dying.

""It is hard to contemplate a more reprehensible set of circumstances.""
