The prosecutor said the girl's phone rang a number of times as people tried to contact her, but Parker terminated one call with an automatic return text message which read: ""Sorry I can't talk right now.""

In a victim personal statement, the girl's mother said the theft was ""yet another blow as to how despicable people could be"".

Supt Chris Hill, from Greater Manchester Police, said: ""No matter what personal circumstances you might find yourself in, to steal from injured and terrified innocent people is deplorable.

""Parker exploited these people when they were at their most vulnerable and needed the help of those around them.""

The judge told Parker he will serve half his sentence in custody before being released on licence.

He also banned him from Manchester city centre for 10 years.

When the story of Parker's ""heroism"" was originally reported, an appeal on the crowdfunding website GoFundMe raised Â£52,000.

A spokesman for GoFundMe said Parker did not receive the money and it has been returned to the donors.",en

A prestigious food guide has allowed a top French restaurant to publicly withdraw from its listings.

Sebastien Bras's Le Suquet restaurant in southern France held Michelin's three-star rating for 18 years.

He shocked the food world in September when he decided to give up his top rating, saying he no longer wanted to cook under the ""huge pressure"" of being judged by its inspectors.
